# 07-MySQL 

Developer has chosen the database MySQL. Hence, we are trying to install it up and configure it.

:::tip Hint
**Versions of the DB Software you will get context from the developer, Meaning we need to check with developer.**
:::

CentOS-8 Comes with MySQL 8 Version by default, However our application needs MySQL 5.7. So lets disable MySQL 8 version.

```shell 
yum module disable mysql -y 
```

Setup the MySQL5.7 repo file

``` shell title=/etc/yum.repos.d/mysql.repo
[mysql]
name=MySQL 5.7 Community Server
baseurl=http://repo.mysql.com/yum/mysql-5.7-community/el/7/$basearch/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

:::tip Hint
Hint! You can create file by using **`vim /etc/yum.repos.d/mysql.repo`**
:::

Install MySQL Server 

```shell 
yum install mysql-community-server -y
```

Start MySQL Service 

```shell 
systemctl enable mysqld
systemctl start mysqld  
```

Next, We need to change the default root password in order to start using the database service. Use password **`RoboShop@1`** or any other as per your choice. 

```shell
mysql_secure_installation --set-root-pass RoboShop@1
```

You can check the new password working or not using the following command in MySQL.

```shell
mysql -uroot -pRoboShop@1
```
