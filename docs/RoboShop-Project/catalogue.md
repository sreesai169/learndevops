# 03-Catalogue

Catalogue is a microservice that is responsible for serving the list of items that displays in roboshop application.

:::tip Hint
**Developer has chosen NodeJs, Check with developer which version of NodeJS is needed.**
**Developer has set a context that it can work with NodeJS >18**
:::

Setup NodeJS repos. Vendor is providing a script to setup the repos. 

```shell 
curl -sL https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_lts.x | bash
```

Install NodeJS 

```shell 
yum install nodejs -y
```

Configure the application.

:::info 
Our application developed by the developer of our org and it is not having any RPM software just like other softwares. So we need to configure every step manually
:::

:::caution Recap
We already discussed in Linux basics section that applications should run as nonroot user.
:::

Add application User

```shell 
useradd roboshop
```

:::info 
User **roboshop** is a function / daemon user to run the application. Apart from that we dont use this user to login to server.

Also, username **roboshop** has been picked because it more suits to our project name.
:::

:::info
We keep application in one standard location. This is a usual practice that runs in the organization.
:::

Lets setup an app directory. 

```shell
mkdir /app 
```

Download the application code to created app directory. 

```shell
curl -o /tmp/catalogue.zip https://roboshop-artifacts.s3.amazonaws.com/catalogue.zip 
cd /app 
unzip /tmp/catalogue.zip
```

Every application is developed by development team will have some common softwares that they use as libraries. This application also have the same way of defined dependencies in the application configuration.

Lets download the dependencies. 

```shell 
cd /app 
npm install 
```

We need to setup a new service in **systemd** so `systemctl` can manage this service

:::info
We already discussed in linux basics that advantages of systemctl managing services, Hence we are taking that approach. Which is also a standard way in the OS. 
:::


Setup SystemD Catalogue Service 

```unit file (systemd) title=/etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service
[Unit]
Description = Catalogue Service

[Service]
User=roboshop
Environment=MONGO=true
// highlight-start
Environment=MONGO_URL="mongodb://<MONGODB-SERVER-IPADDRESS>:27017/catalogue"
// highlight-end
ExecStart=/bin/node /app/server.js
SyslogIdentifier=catalogue

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

:::info
Hint! You can create file by using **`vim /etc/systemd/system/catalogue.service`**
:::

:::caution Note
Ensure you replace `<MONGODB-SERVER-IPADDRESS>` with IP address
:::

Load the service.

```shell 
systemctl daemon-reload
```

:::info 
This above command is because we added a new service, We are telling systemd to reload so it will detect new service.
:::

Start the service.

```shell 
systemctl enable catalogue 
systemctl start catalogue
```

For the application to work fully functional we need to load schema to the Database.

:::tip Info
Schemas are usually part of application code and developer will provide them as part of development.
:::

We need to load the schema. To load schema we need to install mongodb client. 

To have it installed we can setup MongoDB repo and install mongodb-client  

``` shell title=/etc/yum.repos.d/mongo.repo
[mongodb-org-4.2]
name=MongoDB Repository
baseurl=https://repo.mongodb.org/yum/redhat/$releasever/mongodb-org/4.2/x86_64/
gpgcheck=0
enabled=1
```

```shell 
yum install mongodb-org-shell -y
```


Load Schema 

```shell 
mongo --host MONGODB-SERVER-IPADDRESS </app/schema/catalogue.js
```

:::caution Note
You need to update catalogue server ip address in frontend configuration. 
Configuration file is `/etc/nginx/default.d/roboshop.conf`
